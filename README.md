A simple agent-based free market simulator engine. 

This engine consists of various "Agents" trading commodities, with emergent free-floating prices that rise and fall
according to the laws of supply and demand. 

The eventual goal is to create an open-source "Economics engine" for games and simulations, much like
contemporary open-source "Physics engines."

Based on "[Emergent Economies for Role Playing Games](http://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-03.pdf)" by Jonathon Doran and Ian Parberry.
